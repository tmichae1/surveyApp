# surveyApp

This was an application made using django for a local daycare center. It allows admin staff to create questionaires and upload them for staff to take anonymously. Once the survey deadline has been reached, the results of the survey are then proccessed and emailed top the creator in csv format. THe creator is also able to view survey results in the app, but cannot see who gave the answers, keeping anonymity.
